              <p>Web development refers to building, creating, and maintaining websites.
                It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management.
                While the terms "web developer" and "web designer" are often used synonymously, 
                they do not mean the same thing. Technically, a web designer only designs website
                interfaces using HTML and CSS. A web developer may be involved in designing a website,
                but may also write web scripts in languages such as PHP and ASP.
                Additionally,a web developer may help maintain and update a database used by a dynamic website.

              <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a computer language that makes up most web pages
                   and online applications. A hypertext is a text that is used to reference other pieces
                    of text, while a markup language is a series of markings that tells web servers the 
                    style and structure of a document. HTML is very simple to learn and use.

              <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
                It is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colours,
                layout, and fonts, thus making our web pages presentable to the users.
                CSS is designed to make style sheets for the web. It is independent of HTML and
                can be used with any XML-based markup language. CSS is popularly called the design language of the web.

                <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex
                   features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display
                   static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive
                   maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that
                   JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third of the web trio.
