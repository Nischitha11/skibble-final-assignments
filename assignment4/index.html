                    <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents<br>
                      designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as
                       Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML<br>
                        documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.<br> HTML describes the structure 
                        of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

                     presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
                      alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors,

                 of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side
                  for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.
               All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>
